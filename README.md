# BestSF - A sparse Meta-Format for Optimizing SpMV on GPU
BestSF is a new sparse meta-format for optimizing the SpMV kernel on GPU. BestSF is based on a machine leaning approach to select the best sparse format (from COO, CSR, BCSR, ELL, and HYB). 

You can find the code used for calculating the sparsity features used for the learning in bestsf.h. 
The rest of the code will be uploaded very soon.

A scientific paper describing BestSF is currently under review for publication in a scientific journal. A complete description will be soon available here.
